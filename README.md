VMware Guest Console Tool
======================

![VMGCT](https://github.com/vScripter/VMwareGuestConsoleTool/raw/master/VMGCTv1.4.0.PNG)

GUI Tool to launch the console of a powered on VM Guest.

Currently, only powered on guests are included, although, if requested, a version to include all guests can be compiled. This takes into account only reporting on active VMs and not VMs that may be part of SRM, Veaam B&R, etc.

The source form file has been published. The application was written and compiled in PowerShell Studio 2014. If you are looking for the raw PowerShell/PowerCLI code, open 'VmConsoleTool-CE.psf' and scroll to the bottom.

Check out the project page for more information and a download link to the most current build.

Thanks for all your support!

Getting Started
======================

Getting going is pretty straight forward; just visit http://bit.ly/VMwareGCT and either download the .ZIP archive that contains all of the source code and binary or just download the binary (.EXE).

If you receive an error that the app has crashed as soon as you attemtp to open it, ensure that you have all of the prerequisites in place. The most common time I see this is when PowerShell is not running a supported version (3.0, or newer).
