VMwareGuestConsoleTool
======================

GUI Tool to launch the console of a powered on VM Guest.

Currently, only powered on guests are included, although, if requested, a version to include all guests can be compiled. This takes into account only reporting on active VMs and not VMs that may be part of SRM, Veaam B&R, etc.

The source form file has been published. The application was written and compiled in PowerShell Studio 2014. If you are looking for the raw PowerShell/PowerCLI code, open 'VmConsoleTool-CE.psf' and scroll to the bottom.

Check out the project page for more information and a download link to the most current build.
